## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The package layout: `texpkg` (the run time) and `texpkg_build` (the build), with import contracts, the `build` extra
  and the `texpkg-build` entry point (phase 0).
- `Asset`, `Role`, the `Flat` and `Project` layouts and a payload that is written whole or not at all, compared by
  content and checked for stale, missing and extra files (phase 1).
- The declaration (`Distribution`, `Kind`, `Variant`, `Asset`), checked when it is built; the generated module's fixed
  surface (`kinds.names()`, `kinds.modules()`, a kind's `NAME`, classes, `schema()`, `example()`, `variants()`,
  `changes()`, `__version__`, `CONTRACTS`, `errors`) with its protocols; `Document.render` and `replace`; the two schemas of
  a kind; `texpkg_build.testing.load_declaration` (phase 2).
